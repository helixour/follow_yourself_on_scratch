Hey!
Thanks for installing my app!

To use it, open the exe file or you can run the Python file (.py) if you have Python installed.
Type in your Scratch username and password and then it will say in the console that it has finished.
If you think I will collect your username and password, check the Python file (.py) using Notepad or Python and I will prove you wrong!
Have fun!
